An [artificial intelligence](https://www.infobip.com/glossary/ai-chatbot) (AI) chatbot uses machine learning and [natural language processing](https://www.infobip.com/docs/answers/ai-chatbots/nlp) (NLP) to simulate human-like conversations. AI chatbots can understand the context and [intent](https://www.infobip.com/docs/answers/ai-chatbots/intents) of the end user's query and respond accordingly. 

When an AI bot interacts with more end users, you can use analytics to understand their queries and improve the chatbot accordingly. Example: You can identify end user messages for which the chatbot was unable to recognize the correct intent.

AI chatbots are also known as intent-driven chatbots.

## Language

AI chatbots support all languages in which words are separated by a space. So, you can use most of the languages that are supported by Answers to build an AI chatbot.

You cannot use languages in which words are not separated by a space. Example: Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Lao.
